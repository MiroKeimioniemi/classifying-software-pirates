I think prices increase as the software increases in demand and more and more popular artists use it. Prices can decrease as the software gets obsolete, or if in the future it gets easier and easier to program and create music software. Difficult to imagine that there will be many improvements in terms of customizability or versatility of software in the future, because already loads and loads of options have been discovered and we are close to or have already hit a wall. The only improvements possible may be user-friendliness, appearance, optimization, etc. So this is another reason why I think prices may decrease. I enjoyed this survey. Thanks for sharing."

Beyond that, I think a major driving force in marketing and the positioning of the product from a Storytelling place. Plugins like Sausage fattener are popular not only because of the feature but because of the memorability of the design and similar.

Manipulator is branded with Infected Mushroom, the storytelling integration with the artist and the demo's made the plugin much more interesting to me despite me not listening to them a lot.

Similar also Kickstart, which is in a way a simplified version of LFO tools only meant for rhythmic sidechaining, but probably because of the Nicky Romero branding it has gotten a slight cult following."

I would assume that the prices for these plugins is high due to the money invested in the creation of the plugin and the company needing to at least break even.

I like things that sound good but I'm more-or-less committed to Bitwig as my DAW, and I don't want to use too many plugins when there is a lot of robust stuff in the box. That said, I'm interested in Pigments, Serum, Vital and PhasePlant because I would kind of like a featureful wavetable synthesizer with a lot of capability that maybe won't destroy my CPU the way Bitwig's wavetable does.","Lots of people complain about Bitwig's pricing model, but it's familiar to me as a software engineer as the pricing model high-end IDEs have, where you pay X to get in, and then Y < X as a subscriber with free upgrades. I am surprised how unpopular this pricing model seems to be in music production. Vital is also subscription-based. I think this could be useful for getting more hobbyists interested since $10/month for some tool like Pigments is way more palatable than $200 as a one-time purchase, if you don't know really if you're going to like it (although they probably have some kind of demo).

Software still has, rightfully, a reputation as being cheaper than hardware, but some of these synths raise questions about it. You can't really get a real synthesizer for less than $200-300 but the best software synths are also starting in that range. 

I find the VST plugin ecosystem really strange, because every software instrument has a different UI you have to learn. I wonder how much time and money is wasted making different UIs."

I started with Producer Edition since this was clearly the best bang for the buck, but upgraded to the All Plugins Edition last year during the sale. I love their products and how they interact with the community and listen to their userbase. FL is definitely a DAW tailored for my usage making electronic music, and I wouldn't have used it if I was often recording bands and stuff.","3 things.

Firstly, I started making music when I was 9 years old (2009) and until maybe 2013-2014, I used a pirated copy of Fruity Loops 3 (yes, the one that came out in like 2001) and really pushed the software to its limits. I then found a pirated copy of FL Studio 11 and used that for 2-3 years before finally purchasing a legitimate license when I had the means and when I started producing music more seriously and thinking about officially releasing my music. Although I don't use any pirated software anymore on my computer and I'm totally against it and think we should support the developers making and maintaining software, without piracy I wouldn't be where I am today, and maybe would have never purchased a license of FL Studio and then upgraded to all plugins edition (since I missed being able to use all those instruments and FXs!) later down the line. So that's why I have a torn relationship with pirated software since in the end, at least looking at my case, piracy made Image-Line sell me a copy of FL Studio and arguably an upgrade to All-Plugins bundle.

Secondly, I really dislike subscription plans for things that aren't a typical ""service"" (like Netflix, Internet or Electricity for instance), and that includes software and plugins. When I purchase things, I tend to view it as a long-term usage, and paying a monthly fee during a couple of years on something often costs more then buying it from the get-go. I get that sub plans include latest updates and stuff but I still really dislike them and don't see myself spending monthly on those unless I have no choice. I would much prefer spending much more at the beginning and knowing that the software I purchased is 100% mine and that this will never change. I like having control over my stuff.

Thridly: I hate plugin managers software (like the ones Waves, Roland (Roland Cloud), IK Multimedia and lots of other companies have), license managers (especially those who constantly run in the background, and this is one more reason why I like FL Studio so much, it doesn't have obnoxious DRM protection like lots of others have). I'm ok with simple plugin installers but man, can't we just have drag-and-drop .dlls or .vst3 files for stuff that doesn't include a separate sound library or stuff like that? Installers that literally put a .dll in my plugins folders are useless to me.

Anyway, hope that helps, good luck! :)"

Sound Libraries: sounds of KSHMR (Splice) and MHA music (independent), I really like the sounds in general, the packs of both parties have everything I need to make a track.

I had switched to cubase pro 8 for about 2 years, but went back to fl studio and upgraded multiple times because I discovered my workflow relied heavily on synths and automation, not sample editing. FL studio does not inconvenience you with a hardware licensing dongle that breaks often and puts you out of producing for 2 weeks at a time.","it's a very expensive hobby. I think all the prices are higher than they should be, since few musicians make a return on investment. The plugin makers know the pricing standards and are able to all keep prices high, just like how graphics cards are starting to not be sold under $400.
A plugin becomes worth it's while if I get good results over many tracks, in comparison to tracks that didn't use the plugin. I believe the pricing is still plausibly justifiable if either the artist makes a return on investment, or the plugin dramatically increases the musician's workflow and music quality. Artistic talent and learning synthesis plays a much bigger role in how your music sounds and how good it is than expensive vst plugins do."

That said, I support a lot of creators on Patreon and similar places, because I get to support independent artists as well as getting software and synth patches in return which I can always use.
As far as this survey goes, the questions about buying the ""next"" plugin were a little confusingly worded, and also just a bit too abstract to answer confidently.
If you're looking to understand the industry, I'd encourage you to get in touch with creators like Chris from Airwindows (he is pretty passionate about open source, so will offer a different view to others), as well as perhaps the folks at Valhalla who are pretty community-minded while also having a more traditional business model.
I make software for a living (video games), so I do believe in paying developers for their work, but at the same time, I'm very aware of the ability of large players in this area to squeeze markets with enormous advertising budgets, deep discounts to lock in users to their brand, and other tactics. I'm much more likely to be passionate about a product and feel good about it if I understand what it means to the people who make it, and that is a difficult thing to believe from larger companies in which the public faces are generally further away from the real decision-making.

Too many more than I can recall right now.

I am most interested in VSTi and Kontakt instruments.","Pricing is arbitrary and irrational, when there are so many sales/discounts/promotions/etc
on offer at any time.
I never pay full retail price.
Obviously, I end up spending too much.
I own excessive 'pro level' software way beyond my abilities, and time left to learn to use it effectively.
I am over 60, and who knows what the immediate future holds.
From the 1970s to late 90s I only used instruments and hardware limited to 
the basics I could afford.
My attempts at 'making it' in music ground to a halt by the time I was 40.
Now I have access to virtual instruments way beyond the dreams of my youth.
But not much time left to use it.
With no hope any longer of earning from music.
I really need to start selling off my accumulated hardware,
and focus on recording.
Rather than being seduced by weekly software flash sales.
But...
WE are obsessed and hooked on collecting."

xfer - serum
Popular plugin,  a lot of YouTube tutorials, a lot of options when it comes to sound design.","Music production softwares is very expensive overall, so pirating is almost the only option for me to get a decent software without paying a ridiculous amount of money. Yes, there are demo versions and etc. But demos are often so limited that they are unusable in the long run. 

I guess the factors that affect the pricing of digital goods can vary from company to company. But my main guess is that: work hours and expenses which have gone into making the product is the main reason the products are so expensive. A factor on top of that is that the most known music software companies target professional audio production people and not hobbyists and music producers that are not established.

But I've seen a trend now where companies release free software with different options of buying extra stuff later, just like game companies are doing at the moment. A good example is Vital Audio's new plugin which is called Vital and compare it to for example Epic Games - Fortnite."

The Microchip shortage may eventually cause a very surprising twist to both home & professional equipment being available. Will this cause pricing to surge?
Will this be how newer units become the new “holy relic”, because the internal components are top-quality; now becoming more rare, or no longer available?

The other topic, is “subscription” based platforms. They are horribly ‘distasteful’ in my opinion.

I understand a hobbyist or student may appreciate the access to things occasionally, as they need them.
Alternatively, as a professional, we are searching for tools that work, & having to pay for them repeatedly is dramatically different than al previous years of music development. This is how I came to find other companies, like Fabfilter & Arturia- when companies you like start to change, I enjoy the idea of continuing to support companies you are in-line with.

- Dollar values swappable in local currency, possibly a Country field to accompany this so you can sort these entries and convert the values to make the information useful.


People don't tend to like the idea of swapping DAW that much either; a lot of people are probably going to stick with whatever DAW they started to use; unless they find out that an artist they like uses a different one (depending on the person), or find their current one restricting.


People will usually buy anything (if income allows) they're interested in if they can get it at a price they deem reasonable. Obviously that has to be balanced with support though; if a large user base exists, it can cause a drain on support"

I can't give you the exact numbers but let's say you can earn to buy a plugin you like:

in the US: You have to work for 3 days to get it
in Turkey: You have to work 15 days to get it
in India: You have to work 30 days to get it

*roughly calculated in reference to the minimum monthly salary

This all changes depending on the region's wealth and economics, therefore companies should implement a system to solve this and appeal to more customers in countries that are less wealthier than the US (or the EU).

If that 200 USD (about 1800 Turkish Lira, half of monthly min. salary in Turkey) plugin was 50 USD (400 Turkish Lira) in Turkey, I wouldn't pirate it.

Rent-to-own is a great option too, but still, you pay the standardized ""US"" price. You pay 20 USD a month for 24 months to get a DAW for example. Make it 8 USD or 10 USD for Turkey and other countries that have bad economies and watch your sales go skyrocket.

Many people, including me, choose to pirate due to that."

Image-Line produced FL Studio and all of it's gizmos. As an owner of FL, I find myself using the stock plugins most frequently, from Fruity Limiter to Harmor.

Valhalla makes fantastic reverbs and delays. I own Supermassive, Room, and am thinking of getting vintageverb.

Izotope goes on sale frequently, however, they are expensive. I rarely use any of their plugins except for the mastering tool Ozone.

XFer makes Serum and OTT. I use both. A lot. I got Serum through Splice's Rent-to-own.

Matt Tytel makes Vital and Helm. I use the former plenty.

Arturia makes Hardware and software. My midi controller is arturia, my Microbrute Analog Synth is Arturia, and I own Pigments 3, which I got on sale. My use of the synths is RARE, however I acknowledge the power they hold",-

They simply make some of the best plugins for mixing. (Fabfilter let's you get super detailed and technical with your mixing and mastering approach which is why I love it.)

FL studio for DAW (I only picked it because my favourite producers were using it. Knowing what I know now I would say Ableton is better for overall workflow but the piano roll in FL is unmatched)

Sound toys bundle is great, decapitator, echoboy, and little alterboy are amazing plugins. (I like sound toys because they give you quick results and are super easy to use, don't have to get crazy technical with anything)

Xfer - serum (a must) is an amazing vst. And ott it a great and free effect plugin, upward and downward compression with the turn of a single knob. 

Spitfire audio - LABS free vst has some of the best organic and rich sounding pads, keys and even some guitars. This plugin gives producers without the money to record live instruments a huge helping hand. 

As far as sound libraries go, KSHMR vol.2 and 3 are amazing. And any pack by OLIVER has some of the crispest drums ever.

There are so many more but this is just let things I use off the top of my head","Although it is significantly more feasible than previous decades, music production software is still far too expensive for new producers. Many plugin and DAW companies do offer free trials for their products, however they sometimes come with limited functionality or too short a trial period to properly assess the product.

Many young and new producers are not willing to dish out thousands of dollars for these DAWS and plugins without knowing whether they will like producing once they have started. It's simply way too large a financial commitment for most teenagers and young adults to commit too in their early stages of producing. 

I do believe however that most producers who end up making money off of their music do eventually purchase the plugins they have been using."

And honestly, I don't think these reviews are wrong! We're in a wonderful period of music technology where it's easy to create very high-quality plugins and sound libraries, so lots of people throw their hat into the ring and produce quality products. However, plugins and sound libraries can only really do one thing each. There are an enormous number of types of effects and instruments and genres to cover. As a result, there still is room for innovation and competition. Producers need to build up libraries that cover all of their needs, and there's always room for developers to cover a niche that isn't well-explored to differentiate themselves and capture a new part of the market."

Now that I have a full-time career (independent of music production) I can afford to purchase them outright. I have purchased/licensed all plugins/software/samples that I previously used before I could afford them. I believe people deserve to be paid for their work and have made my best effort to purchase all paid products I have used in the past and made donations to software/digital goods I use regularly. I think free non-commercial versions of software would be extremely helpful to those starting out. The economic barrier to entry for music production can be extensive. A computer, monitors, audio interface, midi controllers, DAW, plugins, and samples can get very expensive very quickly. Most companies have free trials but the common 30 day model doesn't feel like enough time to really learn and integrate a new tool to its full capacity. If companies allowed for unlimited non-commercial use (ie no public releases of productions using a non-paid product) I believe they could gain more customers by allowing producers to integrate their products into their essential workflow without requiring payment before the artist uses their software in a commercial setting."

-native instruments komplete is priced 600$ but if you wait for an upgrade sale you can get if for a little over 300 which is less than what kontakt(399$) is supposed to cost which is part of komplete along with like 20 other plugins that are supposedly over 100$
the truth is: with infinite digital replication the value of most plugins cannot be that high as companies themselves seem to try to throw them at you in ridiculous sales all the time

the degree to which prices are bloated is ludicrous and any sane customer would look for an alternative 
but instead of going for cheaper plugins the easier alternative is oftentimes piracy which in turn leads to even higher prices for customers who feel morally obliged to buy the legal version"

- I've only used freebies, but from what I've heard, nobody really buys plugins nowadays, it's just pirating, pirating and pirating. 
- Honestly, there seems to be always free alternatives to paid plugins. I'd say what makes a plugin irreplaceable is it's uniqueness. Making another compressor or filter isn't going to grab any attention, but a reverse effect (like Backmask by Freakshow Industries (will talk about those people more)) definitely would.
- See what Freakshow Industry did. They make extremely weird plugins, and with that they predicted that people would pirate their software. So they literally gave an option to ""steal"" their plugins for absolutely no cost. Like pirating, you'd still get the plugin for free, but you don't have to go on any shady website. A lot of people actually ended up donating to Freakshow."

I am interested in any free software and only buy free software as I have no intention of having a career in music.","I saw a Nathan Larsen video (https://youtu.be/8jZ3CwWes54) where he basically says that because of the pandemic, home studios are more popular than ever and plugin companies are making their products more and more user-friendly, meaning less knobs and buttons and more attention to the visual aesthetics. I can only assume that more and more free softwares will come out, maybe with ""pro"" versions that the user can buy to unlock more features, because that's what sort of happened with the Apple App Store. 
        I watched a documentary a while back where the App Store was being discussed, and it showed how the public image of softwares changed over time. At first, a developer could sell a software for something like $40 because the customers agreed that it was quality software and worth the one-time purchase. However--I forget the underlying reasons--it progressed to the point where today lots of people will stop short of buying an app if it exceeds $1, and instead of having one-time purchases to own a complete software, users will use free or subscription-based software or games that are flooded with ads for different games that do the same thing. 
        So my only assumption is that music production is going to become more normalized than it already has and therefore plugins will become more accessible to the general public, although advanced ones catered towards veteran/expert producers may not change as much."

Native Instruments: innovative and excellent tools, fantastic value, but how much more can they add to Komplete?
2CAudio: go-to spatial reverbs, innovative plugins, sounds beautiful.
XLN: XO is a workflow powerup, RC-20 is a joy to use, Addictive Triggers work very well, Addictive Drums is great all-around.
Spectrasonics: Omnisphere alone is so powerful and innovative. No other tool integrates hardware synths like it does and its performance abilities are unparalleled.
Kilohearts: Their snap-in ecosystem benefited from the introduction of Phase Plant. Lots of new things coming.
LiquidSonics: While 2C Audio is the king of algorithmic reverb, LiquidSonics reigns in convolution. Sure, Altiverb has a huge library of real, inaccessible spaces, but LiquidSonics is innovating things they can't even dream of. First, the Bricasti M7, then totally abstracted reverb that just sounds perfect in situ, in Dolby ATMOS even, with Cinematic Rooms. Just when you thought you didn't need another reverb.

Honorable mentions: Eventide is slowly releasing bits of their H9000 at a time. FXpansion got absorbed by ROLI, is it the end of the line? AAS keeps re-packaging parts of Tassman into new products with better workflow. Izotope is going subscription, and no one really needs a suite for mixing and mastering, but there is no real replacement for RX. Aside from Pro-Q, I can't justify any other FabFilter plugin. LVC Audio makes some interesting plugins with a lot of character. Unfiltered Audio defies expectations, what will they make next? Newfangled Audio as well! Will Zynaptiq ever release Orange Vocoder? They seem to have lost steam. Audiority and Audiothing make interesting, if not niche plugins. UVI and Blue Cat make great tools but don't get a lot of buzz.

Sound libraries: SonicCouture innovates with excellence. Soundiron does some really wacky things in a good way.","I log every purchase and my expenditure graph has a hump in 2016 and it falls sharply after that. I have everything I need. At this point it's whatever improved technology can bring, like AI (which is usually some form of machine learning), or workflow improvements, or a no-brainer trifle, like sure, I could use a kazoo library for the price of a kazoo.

The industry is headed toward commodity prices, it's a race to the bottom and it can't be stopped, thanks to a few companies. Very few companies can resist sales. There will always be new customers, but as people fill their toolboxes and the prices come crashing down, some companies will switch to customer hostile tactics like subscription-only. Fortunately few companies are in a position to do that."

Also, my n°1 advice for friends starting out is to NEVER buy a plugin if it's not on sale.

A tip for the survey: I believe I got into it by the r/edmproduction subreddit, I'd say it should be important to note which type of music each one of the surveyed make, and how much they rely on outboard gear. For example, orchestral plugins tend to cost a lot and rarely go on big sales, so composers tend to have to pay much more for their plugins; electronic musicians don't need to pay as much, although some bundles can get pricey; and hip-hop producers that rely heavily on sampling may not need any external plugins or can ""complete"" their plugin library relatively faster than the rest of music makers."

I think the fact that a plugin, which often has to be operated in the scope of a DAW, can cost as much as or more than a DAW leads to a strange dissonance for buyers --  ""How can the component cost more than the framework/host?""

--What is your guess for the factors affecting the pricing of digital goods in the music production software industry and their relative significances?--
